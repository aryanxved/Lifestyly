# Lifestyly

## The Perfect Student Academic Planner!

### Problem
As a first-year student quickly I found that organization is key to success both academically and mentally. I found that I had been using multiple different programs to get simple tasks such as inputting my grades or organizing my assignments for the week. With the power of Excel, and some VBA I was able to create a simple solution, now known as Lifestyly!
         
### Description

Lifestyly Academic Student Planner is a simple solution to an unorganzied student lifestyle. The planner is built off of Microsoft Excel and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) in the form of a macro-enabled spreadsheet file.

The spreadsheet will also give you insights into the users performance whether it would be about bad grades or incomplete/complete tasks.
